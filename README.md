# Greenlight.API

## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. Please check back later for updates. It is based on a tutorial by [Alex Edwards](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) and is being used as a learning exercise. I will be adding features and functionality as I learn more about Go and web development.

## Overview

Greenlight Movie API is a Go-based application designed to provide a JSON API for retrieving and managing information about movies. The project follows a start-to-finish build approach, resembling the core functionality of the Open Movie Database API. The application is backed by a PostgreSQL database to store and manage movie-related data.
